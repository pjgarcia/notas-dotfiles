** Not eating animals, you motherfucker!
   [[file:angry-cow.jpg]]
   
   There is no excuse. You eat animals because because you like the taste. 
   *You don't need to. It's just a luxury.*
   Animals are not born for you to eat them. You are not a caveman any more.
   It's inmoral to raise animals only to torture, abuse and kill them.
   An empathic, morally healthy society can not tolerate the suffering of other beings, whatever they are.
   Do you recall the last time you saw a dog being hit? How you felt? That anguish deep inside your chest 
   can not be isolated. The livestock industry mantains a torture machine far away from your home. 
   But the truth is out there for you to see it. Wake up.

   + "It's expensive" :: Really? Dont you notice that it is the cheese and ham in your shopping cart 
                         that populates the expensive bill? Grains, cereals, fruits, vegetables and legumes
	                 are the cheap ones.
   + "Animals... don't you see there are other things to be concerned of?" :: Yes, indeed. What do you do
	to make the world a better place? The road to a better society has many paths, one of wich is veganism.
   + "There is simply no space to feed us all with veggies!" :: Wrong, there is. Actually the agriculture industry
	is more efficient than livestock to produce food. So, if you care about the world nutrition, and 
	those who won't have dinner tonight, investigate and fight against this waste of resources.
	
*** Now what? You hungry?
    There is *a lot* of info out there to cook suffering-free food.
